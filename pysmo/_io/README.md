# IO folder

This folder contains generic classes that serve as base classes for pysmo compatible
classes. Typically they aren't used directly in pysmo.

**IMPORTANT:** The `sacio.py` file in this folder is rendered from
a template. Do not edit this file directly, and instead edit either
the `render_sacio.py` file or the template it uses. They can be
found in the `utils` directory.
