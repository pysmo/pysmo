# Testing

Testing scientific code can present a chicken-and-egg problem: the reference
data used to verify results is often generated by the very code being tested.
While this kind of regression testing catches unintended changes, it cannot
detect logical errors in the original implementation. Where possible, test
data should therefore be computed using independent, external tools.

When external reference data is not available, we recommend writing tests that
produce figures (with [matplotlib][]) for manual inspection. Once verified,
these figures serve as reference images for automated comparison in future
test runs via the [pytest-mpl][] extension.
